# dokku-ansible-playbook

This repository contains an ansible playbook for deploying and provisioning your own dokku instance.
It is a companion to the [Managing your dokku instance with ansible]() post on the dokku blog.


Besides the configuration discussed in the blog post, the repository contains several dotfiles that help with automatic linting and testing of the playbook.
